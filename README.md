## 3. Core Features & Implementation

### 3.1 File Upload & Data Processing

**Frontend Component:**
```typescript
const handleFileUpload = async (file: File) => {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', file);
  
  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/upload-transactions`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData,
  });
  
  return response.json();
};
```

**Backend Processing:**
- Standardizes column names (amount, description, date, category, merchant)
- Validates data integrity
- Categorizes transactions
- Generates initial insights

### 3.2 AI-Powered Spending Insights

**Algorithm Features:**
- Category spending analysis with percentages
- Trend detection (increasing/decreasing patterns)
- Anomaly detection for unusual expenses
- Coffee spending alerts (specific use case)

**Implementation:**
```python
def generate_spending_insights():
    category_totals = {}
    for transaction in expenses:
        category = transaction['category']
        amount = transaction['amount']
        category_totals[category] = category_totals.get(category, 0) + amount
    
    # Calculate percentages and trends
    insights = []
    for category, total in category_totals.items():
        percentage = (total / total_expenses * 100)
        trend = 'increasing' if percentage > 20 else 'decreasing'
        insights.append({
            'category': category,
            'total_spent': total,
            'percentage_of_total': percentage,
            'trend': trend
        })
```

### 3.3 Subscription Detection System

**Detection Logic:**
- Identifies recurring merchants
- Analyzes payment consistency
- Uses keyword matching for subscription services
- Calculates confidence scores based on patterns

**Key Features:**
- Automatic detection of Netflix, Spotify, Adobe, etc.
- Confidence scoring (0.5-0.95 range)
- Last transaction tracking
- Monthly cost calculation

### 3.4 Goal Forecasting & Progress Tracking

**Goal Management:**
- Target amount and date setting
- Progress calculation and visualization
- Monthly savings requirements
- Achievement likelihood assessment

**AI Recommendations:**
- Personalized saving strategies
- Spending reduction suggestions
- Timeline adjustments
- Progress optimization tips

## 4. Data Flow Architecture

### 4.1 Data Upload Flow
1. User uploads CSV/Excel file
2. Frontend sends file to Flask API
3. Backend processes and validates data
4. Transactions stored in memory
5. AI insights generated automatically
6. Frontend receives processed data

### 4.2 Insight Generation Flow
1. Raw transactions analyzed
2. Spending categories calculated
3. Subscription patterns detected
4. Goal progress evaluated
5. Recommendations generated
6. Real-time updates to dashboard

## 5. API Design

### Core Endpoints

```
GET /api/transactions          - Fetch all transactions
GET /api/insights/spending     - Get spending analysis
GET /api/subscriptions         - Get detected subscriptions
GET /api/goals                 - Fetch financial goals
GET /api/analytics/summary     - Get overview statistics
POST /api/upload-transactions  - Upload and process files
POST /api/goals                - Create new financial goal
```

### Response Formats
